## Process
The process included installing the virtual environment and the openai and streamlit dependencies. I obtained an OpenAI API key from the website and pasted it into the .streamlit/secrets.toml file. This file is ignored by .gitignore to protect sensitive information. The main app file called chatgpt_clone.py includes all the code needed for the basic chatbot app. Streamlit and OpenAI is imported, the api key was set, and the default model is gpt-4o-mini. The code included initializing chat history, accepting user input, and displaying the chat messages in the chat message container.
